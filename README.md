## Sliding Window
In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size
Examples: [SlidingWindow](https://github.com/kansujiya/DS_Patterns/blob/master/src/SlidingWindow.java)

## Two Pointer
In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray.
Examples: [TwoPointer](https://github.com/kansujiya/DS_Patterns/blob/master/src/TwoPointer.java)
